# SkillGapAI  
**Deep Learning Project**  

A Deep Learning-based system for personalized skill gap analysis and learning path generation.

## Overview  
SkillGapAI is an AI-powered platform designed to help users bridge the gap between their current skills and desired career goals. It provides a structured learning plan, tracks progress, adjusts dynamically, and integrates scheduling to offer a personalized learning experience.

## Features  
- **Skill Gap Analysis** – Identifies gaps between current skills and career goals.  
- **Learning Path Generation** – Creates structured learning plans with timelines.  
- **Progress Tracking** – Logs user progress based on completed tasks and time spent.  
- **Dynamic Adjustment** – Adapts the learning plan based on user progress and feedback.  
- **Schedule Integration** – Aligns learning with the user’s availability.  
- **Feedback Loop** – Allows users to rate task difficulty for continuous improvement.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Deep Learning** – TensorFlow / PyTorch  
- **Backend** – Flask / FastAPI  
- **Frontend** – React.js  
- **Database** – PostgreSQL / Firebase  
- **Version Control** – GitHub  

## Project Setup  
1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/SkillGapAI.git
   cd SkillGapAI
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**  
   - For **Python** dependencies (Backend):  
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - For **React** (Frontend) dependencies:  
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

3. **Run the application**  
   - To start the **Backend**:  
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```
   - To start the **Frontend**:  
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

   The backend should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`, and the frontend on `http://localhost:3000` by default.
